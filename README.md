AI-BASED COURSE RECOMMENDATION & PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS SYSTEM

Background:

Students often struggle with choosing the right elective courses or understanding which subjects they need to focus on for better performance. A data-driven system can help students make informed decisions by analyzing academic performance trends, course difficulty levels, and career aspirations.

Challenges:

Develop an Al-based system for the CSE Department of NIT Durgapur that:

Recommends elective/core courses based on students' academic performance, interests, and career goals.

Predicts student performance in future courses using past grades, attendance, and engagement metrics.

Identifies at-risk students who may need extra guidance.

Generates insights for faculty on course difficulty levels, dropout rates, and improvement areas using visualization dashboards.
